# Temperature-Calculator-GUI-in-tkinter

Temperature calculator created in tkinter 

My first ever GUI in python and tkinter 

The goal for this is to improve my knowledge in tkinter and create a real calculator in the future

**How to use it**

install python and ttkbootstrap in your command line

--pip install python--

--pip install ttkbootstrap--

**In your Command line**

--cd (folder name)--

--python (python file name.py)--

No need to install tkinter because it's built into the python standard library
